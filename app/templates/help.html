            <li class="lead">Why 80 entries per account? Why not 50, or 100?</li>
            <p>80 entries will give most people about two months worth of history, based on someone recording two entries per day, five days a week. Less than two months history doesn't feel like enough, and more than this starts to impact on the storage requirements and cost of running the service.</p>
