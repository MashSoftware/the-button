## [Unreleased](https://github.com/MashSoftware/the-button/compare/master...develop)

## [0.23.0](https://github.com/MashSoftware/the-button/compare/v0.22.0...v0.23.0) - 2020-12-31

### [Blog](https://medium.com/mash-software/the-button-weekly-summaries-comments-and-ui-upgrade-d543945069d4)

### Added

- Weekly summary card displaying total of time entries and progress against scheduled time, along with total time per tag used.
- Comments of up to 64 characters can be added to new or existing time entries.
- Automated unit test suite for bespoke (non-framework/package related) and common code.
- Set up [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI/CD workflow to check dependencies are up-to-date, run code quality linting and automated unit tests prior to deployment.
- Improved new user experience with pointers to create tags and set time schedule if an account has none.
- Added unique ID to each time card, allowing for URI fragment linking within the entries page.
- Provide positive feedback for successfully validated form fields on submit.

### Changed

- Updated to Bootstrap v5 Beta 1 now that new features and breaking changes have stabalised. This encompasses a large number of UI changes required to upgrade.
- Moved progress bar from above time entry cards to below the "Start now" button, within the new weekly summary card.
- Refactored repeated code into common utilities module and replaced all instances with calls to a singular methods.
- Refactored time card template to include actions block where appropriate, reducing repeated code and increasing ease of change.
- On desktop device widths buttons will space out horizontally, dropping to vertically stacked block buttons on mobile device widths.

### Removed

- Removed JQuery since it is no longer required by Bootstrap v5.

### Fixed

- Decimal hours calculation to display non-rounded floating point numbers, to two decimal places. Durations are no longer rounded, so 59 minutes and 59 seconds is represented correctly as 0.99 decimal hours, not rounded to 1.0.

## [0.22.0](https://github.com/MashSoftware/the-button/compare/v0.21.1...v0.22.0) - 2020-11-28

### Added

- Weekly time entry view, showing time entries recorded in a specific week, along with a progress indicator of time recorded against scheduled weekly hours.

- Updated design of account page.

### Fixed

- "Start/stop" button displayed the wrong text for new users with no entries, now corrected. Thanks [@russwillis](https://github.com/russwillis).
- An unsuccessful login attempt hit the rate limiter due to the redirect to the same page, added a 1 second sleep to overcome.

### Added

- Capture user selected time zone on sign up.
- Update time zone in account details.

### Changed

- Timezones and conversions are now handled server-side based on the users selected timezone in their account.
- Existing accounts have a default UTC timezone until set by the user.
- All primary action buttons are now larger than non-primary actions, to help the user identify the intended action to take.
- All buttons are now block sized, to improve hit target on mobile devices and for consistency on all devices.
- Reduced responsive breakpoint for forms so fields don't render full page width on iPad sized devices.

### Removed

- Removed Flask Moment (and therefore MomentJS) in favour of server-side timezone handling.
- Removed approximate time since started for in-progress entries.
- Removed "Go back" button on forms, since this just replicates browser back in most cases.
- Removed stopwatch icon from start/stop button.

### Fixed

- Fixed error when trying to localise a non-existant timestamp for accounts that have never been updated.

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/MashSoftware/the-button/compare/v0.10.1...v0.11.0) - 2019-05-07

### Added

### Changed

- Simplified time entry card layout
- Using 24 hour time format
- Grouped entries by start date
- Moved delete time entry button from card to edit page to prevent accidental deletions
- Handle times that span dates by showing the end date and time
- Added icon and "now" to the button to make it clear the action relates to the current time

### Fixed

- Editing times in Chrome resulted in an error due to the `datetime-local` picker tool removing seconds. Changed inputs to `text` type rather than HTML5 `datetime-local` to improve compatibility at the expense of browser/device native pickers. Needs further investigation to improve user experience. Thanks [@mattgirdler](https://github.com/mattgirdler).
