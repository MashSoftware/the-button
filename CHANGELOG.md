## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.1] - 2019-05-22

### Fixed

- "Start/stop" button displayed the wrong text for new users with no entries, now corrected.
- An unsuccessful login attempt hit the rate limiter due to the redirect to the same page, added a 1 second sleep to overcome.
- Spacing between the new split button and the first date entry on mobile was a little close, added some padding.

## [0.14.0] - 2019-05-21

### Added

- Pagination of time entries, with 10 per page.
- Controls to navigate paginated time entries.
- Manual time entry form, accessible via dropdown on split start/stop button.

## [0.13.0] - 2019-05-17

### Added

- Require fresh login in order to update account details, change password or delete account.
- Rate limiting backed by Redis.
- Global rate limits of 1 per second and 60 per minute for all unauthenticated requests, based on remote IP address.
- Specific rate limits of 1 per second for authenticated requests to account and time related actions, based on user ID.
- Enabled gzip compression.

### Changed

- Strip whitespace from around template tags to reduce the size of output html pages.

### Fixed

- Fixed an error that occurred when editing a time entry with no end timestamp due to null timezone conversion.

## [0.12.0] - 2019-05-14

### Added

- Capture user selected time zone on sign up.
- Update time zone in account details.

### Changed

- Timezones and conversions are now handled server-side based on the users selected timezone in their account.
- Existing accounts have a default UTC timezone until set by the user.
- All primary action buttons are now larger than non-primary actions, to help the user identify the intended action to take.
- All buttons are now block sized, to improve hit target on mobile devices and for consistency on all devices.
- Reduced responsive breakpoint for forms so fields don't render full page width on iPad sized devices.

### Removed

- Removed Flask Moment (and therefore MomentJS) in favour of server-side timezone handling.
- Removed approximate time since started for in-progress entries.
- Removed "Go back" button on forms, since this just replicates browser back in most cases.
- Removed stopwatch icon from start/stop button.

### Fixed

- Updating account details and _not_ changing email address generated a validation error, because the email address is already in use. Now if the email address is not changed no validation error occurrs.
- Fixed error when trying to localise a non-existant timestamp for accounts that have never been updated.

## [0.11.0] - 2019-05-07

### Added

- Display approximate time since started for in-progress entries
- Auto refresh time since started every minute

### Changed

- Simplified time entry card layout
- Using 24 hour time format
- Grouped entries by start date
- Moved delete time entry button from card to edit page to prevent accidental deletions
- Handle times that span dates by showing the end date and time
- Added icon and "now" to the button to make it clear the action relates to the current time

### Fixed

- Editing times in Chrome resulted in an error due to the `datetime-local` picker tool removing seconds. Changed inputs to `text` type rather than HTML5 `datetime-local` to improve compatibility at the expense of browser/device native pickers. Needs further investigation to improve user experience.
